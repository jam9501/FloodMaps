    <h1>Flood risk levels in Nassau County compared to median insurance rates in 2024</h1>
    <p>
        In Nassau County, flood insurance costs vary significantly based on the municipality's risk level for storm surges. The median current annual cost of flood insurance ranges from $464 in Roosevelt to as high as $2,132 in Bayville. These costs are influenced by the municipality’s flood risk, with many areas experiencing high storm surge vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Municipalities with the highest flood risk, such as Atlantic Beach, Long Beach, and Arverne, show insurance costs above $1,000, with storm surge levels nearing 100 percent. However, the highest storm surge risk does not always correspond to the highest insurance cost. For example, Atlantic Beach, with a 99.9 percent storm surge risk, has a cost of $1,290, while Bayville, with a lower risk, has a cost of $2,132.
    </p>
    <p>
        Areas with low or moderate risk, like Franklin Square and Roosevelt, feature lower insurance premiums, often under $800, with storm surge levels closer to 0 percent.
    </p>
    <p>
        On average, the median cost of flood insurance across the county hovers around $1,000. The <strong>National Flood Insurance Program</strong> determines premiums based on an individual property’s specific flood risk, considering factors like the likelihood of various flood perils, building characteristics, proximity to flood sources, and the property’s replacement cost. This approach is more precise than the previous method, which relied on geographic zones and elevation. Because flood risk can change over time, premiums may also adjust as communities' risks evolve.
